# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing and balancing new weapon systems
- Shop system improvements
- Visual feedback enhancements

## Recent Changes
1. Added new weapon types:
   - Plasma Cannon
   - Rocket Launcher
   - Auto-targeting system
2. Implemented weapon upgrades:
   - Damage multipliers
   - Fire rate improvements
