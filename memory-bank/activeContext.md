# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing wave-based progression system
- Adding shop system for upgrades
- Enhancing visual environment with background buildings
- Balancing game difficulty

## Recent Changes
1. Added Wave System:
   - Monsters get stronger each wave
   - Health and speed scaling
   - Visual feedback for wave progression
   - Coin rewards for completing waves

2. Added Shop System:
   - Three upgradeable items:
     - Health Upgrade (100 coins)
     - Speed Upgrade (150 coins)
     - Damage Upgrade (200 coins)
   - Persistent upgrades between games
   - Visual feedback for purchases
   - Coin economy system

3. Enhanced Visual Environment:
   - Added background buildings
   - Dynamic ground level with grass
   - Wave-based background changes
   - Improved monster appearances

4. Game Balance:
   - Increased base monster health
   - Adjusted wave scaling
   - Added coin rewards
   - Progressive difficulty system

## Active Decisions
1. Wave Progression:
   - Monsters get 20% more health per wave
   - Speed increases by 30% per wave
   - 50 coins reward per wave completion
   - 10 monsters per wave

2. Shop System:
   - Upgrades persist between deaths
   - Clear visual feedback for purchases
   - Balanced upgrade costs
   - Maximum levels for each upgrade

3. Visual Design:
   - 8-bit style graphics
   - Dynamic backgrounds
   - Progressive building damage
   - Atmospheric effects

## Next Steps
1. Potential Features:
   - Add more shop items
   - Implement power-ups
   - Add boss monsters
   - Create special effects

2. Balance Considerations:
   - Fine-tune upgrade costs
   - Adjust wave difficulty scaling
   - Balance coin economy
   - Review monster spawn rates

3. Visual Improvements:
   - Add more building details
   - Enhance background effects
   - Improve upgrade feedback
   - Add particle effects

## Important Patterns
1. Wave Management:
   - Clear wave completion conditions
   - Progressive difficulty scaling
   - Reward system integration
   - Visual feedback for progression

2. Shop System:
   - Persistent upgrades
   - Clear purchase feedback
   - Balanced economy
   - Visual state management

3. Visual Design:
   - Consistent 8-bit style
   - Dynamic environment changes
   - Clear feedback systems
   - Atmospheric effects

## Project Insights
1. Game Balance:
   - Wave progression needs careful tuning

   - Difficulty curve should be smooth
   - Rewards should feel meaningful

2. User Experience:
   - Clear feedback is essential
   - Visual progression helps engagement
   - Persistent upgrades add depth
   - Atmosphere enhances immersion

3. Technical Considerations:
   - State management is crucial
   - Visual effects need optimization
   - Upgrade system must be robust
   - Wave system needs flexibility
