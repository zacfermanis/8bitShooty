# System Patterns

## Core Architecture

### Game State Management
- State machine pattern for game states (menu, playing, gameover, shop)
- Central game state object containing:
  - Current state
  - Score
  - Wave number
  - Monster counts
  - Shop data

### Entity System
- Player entity with:
  - Position
  - Health
  - Speed
  - Armor
  - Shield
- Projectile system with:
  - Multiple types (default, plasma, rocket)
  - Damage calculations
  - Special effects
- Monster system with:
  - Different types (basic, armored, elite)
  - Health scaling
  - Speed scaling

### Weapon System
- Modular weapon types:
  - Default gun
  - Shotgun (spread)
  - Laser gun (fast)
  - Plasma cannon (high damage)
  - Rocket launcher (splash)
- Upgrade system:
  - Damage multipliers
  - Fire rate
  - Auto-targeting

## Design Patterns

### Component Pattern
- Entities composed of components:
  - Position
  - Health
  - Movement
  - Weapon
  - Visual effects

### Observer Pattern
- Event system for:
  - Score updates
  - Health changes
  - Wave completion
  - Shop purchases

### Factory Pattern
- Projectile creation
- Monster spawning
- Shop item generation

## Critical Paths

### Combat Loop
1. Player input
2. Weapon firing
3. Projectile creation
4. Collision detection
5. Damage application
6. Score/coin updates

### Shop System
1. Wave completion
2. Shop state transition
3. Item display
4. Purchase validation
5. Upgrade application
6. Return to game

### Wave Progression
1. Monster count tracking
2. Wave completion check
3. Difficulty scaling
4. Background updates
5. Shop access

## System Architecture
1. Core Systems:
   - Game state management
   - Wave progression system
   - Shop and upgrade system
   - Visual environment system
   - Input handling

2. Game States:
   - Menu
   - Playing
   - Game Over
   - Shop

3. Component Relationships:
   - Player -> Gun -> Projectiles
   - Wave -> Monsters -> Rewards
   - Shop -> Upgrades -> Player Stats
   - Environment -> Visual Effects

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Game Engine:
   - LÃ–VE (Love2D) for 2D game development
   - Lua for game logic
   - Built-in physics and graphics

2. State Management:
   - Centralized game state
   - Wave progression tracking
   - Shop system persistence
   - Upgrade management

3. Visual System:
   - 8-bit style graphics
   - Dynamic background system
   - Building damage visualization
   - Wave-based environment changes

## Design Patterns
1. Wave System:
   - Wave state tracking
   - Monster scaling
   - Reward distribution
   - Visual feedback

2. Shop System:
   - Upgrade management
   - Purchase validation
   - Effect application
   - State persistence

3. Visual Design:
   - Consistent 8-bit style
   - Dynamic environment
   - Progressive damage
   - Atmospheric effects

## Critical Implementation Paths
1. Game Loop:
   - State updates
   - Input handling
   - Collision detection
   - Visual rendering

2. Wave Management:
   - Wave progression
   - Monster spawning
   - Difficulty scaling
   - Reward distribution

3. Shop System:
   - Purchase handling
   - Upgrade application
   - State persistence
   - Visual feedback

## Component Relationships
1. Player System:
   - Movement controls
   - Shooting mechanics
   - Health management
   - Upgrade effects

2. Monster System:
   - Spawning patterns
   - Movement AI
   - Health tracking
   - Wave scaling

3. Environment System:
   - Background management
   - Building states
   - Visual effects
   - Wave changes

## Technical Considerations
1. Performance:
   - Object pooling
   - State management
   - Visual optimization
   - Update efficiency

2. Maintainability:
   - Clear state management
   - Modular systems
   - Consistent patterns
   - Clear feedback

3. Extensibility:
   - Wave system flexibility
   - Shop item addition
   - Visual effect expansion
   - Feature integration
